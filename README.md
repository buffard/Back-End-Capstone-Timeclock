# Welcome to Shift Tally
> A Python Django web app that allows users to track their employees, employee's personal info, and allows employees to record their working hours. 

## Background
I spent most of my twenties working for coffee shops and a few other small businesses.  I noticed that in most of these positions the owner didn't have a good resource for a time clock.  Most of the small businesses I worked at had employees write down their hours in an excel sheet or on a piece of paper and turn it in. I wanted to create an option for small business owners to keep track of hours.
